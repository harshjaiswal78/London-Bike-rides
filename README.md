## 🔍 Methodology and Analysis

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Removed or imputed missing entries in ride duration, weather conditions, or station data.
   - **Normalize Columns**: Standardized time formats and unit conversions (e.g., temperature in °C).
   - **Merge Datasets**: Combined weather and bike ride datasets on common time fields for integrated analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Usage Trends**: Visualized bike usage across different times of the day, days of the week, and seasons.
   - **Weather Impact**: Examined correlations between temperature, rainfall, and bike demand.
   - **Location Analysis**: Mapped starting and ending station trends to determine high-demand routes.

### 3. **Demand Forecasting**:
   - Developed predictive models to forecast bike demand based on historical trends and weather data.
   - Used regression analysis to assess the impact of temperature and rainfall on bike usage.

## 🔍 Findings and Insights

### 1. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Weekday mornings (7 AM - 9 AM) and evenings (5 PM - 7 PM) experience the highest bike usage, driven by commuters.
   - Weekends show a shift toward recreational use, with peak activity in the afternoon (12 PM - 4 PM).
   - Seasonal variations indicate higher usage during spring and summer months compared to fall and winter.

### 2. **Weather Impact**:
   - Rainfall significantly reduces bike usage, with a sharp decline observed on days with >5mm rainfall.
   - Moderate temperatures between 15°C and 20°C are optimal for bike rides, resulting in a higher number of trips.

### 3. **Location Insights**:
   - Central London stations near business hubs (e.g., Canary Wharf, The City) see high weekday usage.
   - Popular recreational routes include locations near parks and tourist attractions (e.g., Hyde Park, Thames River routes).
   - Underserved areas were identified in outer boroughs, suggesting opportunities for expansion.

### 4. **Demand Forecasting**:
   - Historical data trends reveal a consistent increase in bike usage during warmer months.
   - Predicted demand aligns closely with real-world data, offering actionable insights for future planning.
